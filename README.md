Here's what each part of the contract does:

Public Variables: The contract has three public variables to store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.

Mapping: The contract uses a mapping named balances to store the token balances of various addresses.

Mint Function: The mint function allows the creation of new tokens. It takes two parameters: _address (the address to mint tokens to) and _value (the number of tokens to mint). It increases the total supply by _value and increments the balance of the specified address by _value.

Burn Function: The burn function allows the destruction of tokens. It takes two parameters: _address (the address to burn tokens from) and _value (the number of tokens to burn). It checks if the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to _value before reducing the total supply and decreasing the balance of the address by _value.
